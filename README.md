### Software Engineer

Software engineer with a proven ability to effectively collaborate in teams of various sizes and skill compositions. In a prior role, I was given the opportunity and freedom to develop an Android app based on the existing IOS app that allowed users to purchase and manage tokens in a wallet-based user interface for a crypto currency. The app maintained a 92% user rating while generating $100K+ in revenue. As a life-long learner with a passion for coding, I followed my Associates degree by attending a 1,000+ hour bootcamp to gain a deeper understanding of Javascript, React, and full stack development. I am now eager to apply these passions to a team whose goal is to contribute to the betterment of society through powerful and intuitive front-end applications.
